                    <p>
                    <h5>1. Scope of personal data processing</h5>
                    In general, the GFZ only processes personal data collected from users insofar as this is
                    necessary to provide a functional website with the relevant content and services. As a rule,
                    personal data provided by users is only processed with the respective user's consent. Exceptions
                    apply in cases where the user’s prior consent cannot be obtained on factual grounds and
                    statutory regulations permit the processing of personal data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h5>
                    Art. 6 no. 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis when the
                    GFZ obtains a data subject's consent to the processing of his/her personal data.<br>
                    Art. 6 no. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis when processing personal data for the performance
                    of a contract to which the data subject is a party. The same applies to any processing measures that
                    are required if steps are to be taken before entering into a contract.<br>
                    Art. 6 no. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis when the processing of personal data is necessary
                    for compliance with a legal obligation to which the GFZ is subject.<br>
                    Art. 6 no. 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis when processing is necessary to safeguard the
                    legitimate interests of the GFZ or a third party, and provided these legitimate interests are not
                    outweighed by the data subject’s interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>3. Data erasure and storage period </h5>
                    The data subject's personal data is erased or blocked as soon as the purpose for which it was stored
                    ceases to apply. Personal data may also be stored if so specified by European or national
                    legislators in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the data controller is subject. In
                    such instances, personal data is blocked or erased when a retention period specified in any of the
                    above-named legislation expires, unless it has to be retained for longer in order to conclude or
                    execute a contract.

                    <h5>1. Description and scope of data processing</h5>
                    Every time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from
                    the accessing computer system.<br>
                    The following information is stored in the web server’s log files:
                    <ul>
                        <li> the date and time of the request</li>
                        <li>the client’s specific request, including the HTTP method, HTTP protocol version, and the
                            path of
                            the resource requested</li>
                        <li>the status code sent back to the client by the server</li>
                        <li>the size of the resources requested</li>
                        <li>the client program identifier</li>
                    </ul>
                    This data is also stored in our system’s log files. However, it is not stored together with
                    other personal data collected from the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>2. Purpose of data processing</h5>
                    This data is used to optimise website use, correct errors, and safeguard the security of our
                    information technology systems. Data collected in this context is not evaluated for marketing
                    purposes.<br>
                    The above-named purposes also constitute the GFZ’s legitimate interest in processing the data
                    pursuant to Art. 6 no. 1 lit. f GDPR.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>3. Storage period</h5>
                    The data is erased as soon as it is no longer required to fulfil the purpose for which it was
                    collected. Log files are deleted within 7 days maximum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>4. Right to object and right to erasure</h5>
                    The collection of data for website provision and the storage of data in log files are absolutely
                    essential to the operation of the website. The user is therefore unable to assert any right to
                    object in this context.

                    <h4>Scientific data submission via the website</h4>
                    <p>
                    <h5>1. Description and scope of data processing</h5>
                    ELMO is a web application to submit scientific datasets to be stored in the GFZ Data Services
                    database for publishing them. If a data subject contacts the controller using the meta data
                    submission application, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically
                    stored.<br>
                    To successfully submit scientific datasets to GFZ Data Services, the data subject has to provide
                    some additional personal data (e.g., name of authors and co-authors, name and email address of a
                    contact person) to allow correct citation of those datasets in the scientific community. This
                    information will be made available to the public after the submission process through dataset
                    metadata (in XML or JSON format and via the GFZ Data Services website). This is a requirement of
                    scientific publishing. Scientific data publications including the aforementioned personal data
                    may be consumed by third parties (e.g., libraries, data portals) using the GFZ Data Services.

                    <p>
                    <h5>2. Legal basis for data processing </h5>
                    By submitting scientific data to the controller, the data subject agrees with publishing those
                    datasets in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical
                    purposes according to Art. 9(2) lit. j GDPR and Art. 89 GDPR.

                    <p>
                    <h5>3. Purpose of data processing </h5>
                    Personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored
                    for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.<br>
                    The Purpose is publication of research data and to allow correct citation of those datasets in the
                    scientific community. Scientific data publications including the aforementioned personal data may be
                    consumed by third parties (e.g., libraries, data portals) using the GFZ Data Services.

                    <h5>1. Scope of Personal Data Processing</h5>
                    This website embeds videos from YouTube, a service operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San
                    Bruno, CA 94066, USA, a subsidiary of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA
                    94043, USA.<br>

                    When a user visits a page containing an embedded YouTube video, their browser may automatically
                    connect to YouTube’s servers, transmitting data such as:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The specific sub-page of our website that was accessed.
                        </li>
                        <li>The user's IP address and potentially other browser/device information.</li>
                    </ul>
                    If the user is logged into their YouTube account, YouTube may associate this data with their
                    account. Even if the user does not interact with the video, YouTube may still collect data and set
                    cookies on their device.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>2. Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data</h5>
                    The legal basis for integrating YouTube videos is:<br>
                    Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR): Videos will only be loaded after users explicitly agree to YouTube's
                    data processing (e.g., via a cookie consent banner).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h5>3. Purpose of Data Processing</h5>
                    The integration of YouTube allows us to provide multimedia content, enhancing the usability and
                    informational value of our website. Data collected by YouTube may also be used for analytics,
                    targeted advertising, or other purposes as outlined in Google’s privacy policy.
